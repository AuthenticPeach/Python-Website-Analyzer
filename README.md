Limitations and Improvements
The program assumes the web page is in HTML format and may not handle other formats correctly.
It does not handle dynamically generated content or JavaScript-based web pages.
The word frequency calculation does not exclude common stop words or account for stemming/lemmatization.
The program does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and outputs the results to the console.
